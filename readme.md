> A simple (configurable) way to mass unfollow your Twitter followings

If your Twitter following is a mess and you'd like to start afresh, look no further. `Twitter Mass Unfollow` will automagically unfollow all or some of your following so you don't have to "clicky clicky" because let's face it, no one has the time for that.

With an option page that allows you to whitelist/exclude followings that are precious to you :)

## Prerequisites

- A computer (lol)
- [Google Chrome browser](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

## Usage

- [Install the extension from Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/twitter-mass-unfollow/bidolfkgmbnlnijabkjafdajjpocfhol)
  - TIP: Pin it for easy access
- Visit your [Twitter following page](https://twitter.com/following)
- Choose "ALL" to unfollow all followings or "NOT FOLLOWING" to unfollow accounts you follow that are not following you
- Use "STOP" to abort the whole process

## NOTE

By default, the unfollow process runs for 1 minute (which can be turned off in the extension options page). This is a safety measure to not violate [Twitter Rule](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/twitter-follow-limit) which could lead to having your account restricted by Twitter. **If turned off, it will run until there's no one to unfollow & you'd have to manually "STOP" the process as you see fit**
