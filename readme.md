> A simple (configurable) way to mass unfollow your Twitter followings

If your Twitter following is a mess and you'd like to start afresh, look no further. `Twitter Mass Unfollow` will automagically unfollow all or some of your following so you don't have to "clicky clicky" because let's face it, no one has the time for that.
